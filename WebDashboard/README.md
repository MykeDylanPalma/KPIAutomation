This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

Run the KPIAutomation API on port `5001` You'll be able to run the app without the API, but you'll not see any data.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
